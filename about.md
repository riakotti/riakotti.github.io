My name is Eleftheria (Ria) Kotti. I have more than 6.5 years of experience in applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques.  

For the most of the last two years as a Principal Statistician, I am providing high-quality statistical support to CMC team in GSK, where I successfully support scientists at different groups, aiming to improve decision-making.  So far I have received five awards for my high-quality, innovative and valuable contribution to team’s and company's success! 

Before that, I completed the requirements for a PhD in Statistical Science and Machine Learning at UCL. I was a member of ﻿the Centre for Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML). I performed variable selection via penalization, Machine Learning and Bayesian approaches to build predictive models for improving clinical diagnosis of various types of cancer (binary and multi-class classification studies).  Technical expertise includes strong programming skills in different languages and ability to quickly learn new software. I have also more than 6.5 years of successful experience in developing and delivering statistical training material for statisticians and non-statistician in various topics. 


Before joining UCL, I received my master's degree in 'Statistics & Mathematical Modeling', from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. I completed my master thesis under the supervision of Prof. George Tsaklidis. 

Prior to my master, I studied Mathematics at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The final year I worked by Assistant Prof. Aleka Papadopoulou and Prof. George Tsaklidis. into two different projects.
